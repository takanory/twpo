.. note::

   One of my best, inspired by my trips to America's heartland.  Suggestive of prairie scenes, romantic, wild, exciting, and rhythmic!  This one plays by itself -- a great seller here and abroad.  Nice playable melodies and countermelodies.  Fun to conduct and play.

Program Notes
-------------
**Song of the Prairie** is a program selection in a single movement.
Much of the melodic material is based upon elements of the Dorian scale.
The work features the presentation and development of ideas which are purely musical.
Interpretation (or extra-musical meaning) is left to the imagination of the listener.

Performance Suggestions
-----------------------
Muych of the principal melodic material utilizes elements of the Dorian scale:

フラっと3つ(ドリア旋法の図 ドレミファソラ(ナチュラル)シ)

The motive (ドミシソーの図) is a prominent element which appears frequently (sometimes with slight alterations) throughout the work, and the phrase

(ドミシソーミファソラファソーの図)

forms the basis for much of the melodic material.
This phrase is vigen a new treatment at measure 51 and throughout a large portion of the Allegro section.

Material at measure 25 (melody in the high woodwinds, cornets and trumpets; countermelody by saxophones and horns) represents a release from the principal theme.
This appears also in measures 71 and 129.
Elements of the principal and secondary melodies are contained in the final eight measures.

Best results will be achieved if the director observes suggested tempo indications.
Attention should also be paid to dynamics, articulations, and phrasing.
Accented notes in the Allegro section will be most effective if they are separeted slightly.
Finnaly, the director should strive to attain balance among various sections of the band in tuttu passages.
