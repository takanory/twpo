.. note::

   One of my best, inspired by my trips to America's heartland.  Suggestive of prairie scenes, romantic, wild, exciting, and rhythmic!  This one plays by itself -- a great seller here and abroad.  Nice playable melodies and countermelodies.  Fun to conduct and play.

プログラムの解説
----------------
.. **Song of the Prairie** is a program selection in a single movement.
   Much of the melodic material is based upon elements of the Dorian scale.
   The work features the presentation and development of ideas which are purely musical.
   Interpretation (or extra-musical meaning) is left to the imagination of the listener.

**大草原の歌** は単一楽章の曲です。
多数の旋律のパーツはドリア旋法に基づいています。
純粋に音楽的な考えによって表現、発展していくことがこの作品の特徴です。
曲の解釈(または音楽以外の意味)は聴衆の想像力に任されています。

.. Performance Suggestions

演奏についての提案
------------------
.. Much of the principal melodic material utilizes elements of the Dorian scale:

主題の多くはドリア旋法の要素を使用しています。

.. figure:: prairie-2.png

.. The motive |prairie| is a prominent element which appears frequently (sometimes with slight alterations) throughout the work, and the phrase

以下の動機は曲の中でしばしば(時々はわずかに変更されて)現れる重要な要素です。

.. image:: prairie-1.png

.. forms the basis for much of the melodic material.
   This phrase is begin a new treatment at measure 51 and throughout a large portion of the Allegro section.

そして、以下のフレーズは旋律的な材料の基礎となります。

.. image:: prairie-3.png

このフレーズは51小節目から新しい形式で開始され、Allegroの大部分を通して演奏されます。

.. Material at measure 25 (melody in the high woodwinds, cornets and trumpets; countermelody by saxophones and horns) represents a release from the principal theme.

また、25小節目の要素(木管高音、コルネット、トランペットによる旋律とサックス、ホルンによる対旋律)は主題からの開放を意味しています。

.. This appears also in measures 71 and 129.
   Elements of the principal and secondary melodies are contained in the final eight measures.

この要素は71小節目と129小節目に再度現れます。
第1と第2のメロディーの要素は最後の8小節にも含まれています。

.. Best results will be achieved if the director observes suggested tempo indications.
   Attention should also be paid to dynamics, articulations, and phrasing.
   Accented notes in the Allegro section will be most effective if they are separated slightly.
   Finally, the director should strive to attain balance among various sections of the band in tutti passages.

指導者が提案したテンポを守ることによって、最高の演奏をすることができます。
ダイナミクス(強弱)、アーティキュレーション(発音)とフレージング(歌い方)にも注意をはらう必要があります。
Allegro部のアクセントが付いている音に間隔をわずかに付けると、非常に効果的になります。
最後に、指導者はバンド全体でのtuttiで演奏する部分で、セクション間でのバランスをとるように努める必要があります。

シンフォニア・フェスティーバ
============================
:原題: Sinfonia Festiva
:作曲: アーン・ラニング(Arne Running)

.. about the composition

曲の構成について
---------------------
.. SINFONIA FESTIVA is in three movements.
   First is a Fanfare which opens with powerful proclamations by brasses and drums.
   The woodwinds interrupt with an allegro passage of whirling fury and brilliance.
   A climax is reached with all instruments vigorously hammering a major triad which gradually grows more violently dissonant and heavy.
   A powerful drum roll and a tutti unison statement of the opening theme releases the tension and the movement concludes triumphantly.

シンフォニア・フェスティーバは3つの楽章で構成されています。
第1楽章の「ファンファーレ」は金管と打楽器による力強い宣言で始まります。
木管は激しさと輝きがめまぐるしく入れ替わるAllegroのパッセージで宣言を遮ります。
全ての楽器によって力強く繰り返される「長三和音」が、徐々により大きく、より激しく、不協和音となり重くなって、クライマックスに達します。
力強いドラムロールと最初のテーマを全体でのユニゾン演奏はクライマックスの緊張を緩和し、この楽章は勝利の喜びを感じて終了します。

.. The second movement is an Aira.
   The warm and lyrical melody is gently played by the low woodwinds.
   The melody is then stated forte by the upper woodwinds, who augment their version with expressive melismas.
   A tender solo for flute provides a gentle closing.

第2楽章は「アリア」です。
暖かく叙情的なメロディは低音木管により穏やかに演奏されます。
そして、このメロディは高音の木管楽器によりフォルテで演奏され、表情の豊な装飾的メロディー(melisma)を加えていきます。
フルートによる柔らかいソロによって曲は穏やかに終了します。

.. The final movement is a brilliant Toccata.
   The movement begins with the woodwinds dancing in rhythmic fury.
   Brasses and percussion follow with a strutting military march.
   A lyrically lilting, then vigorous middle section leads to a recapitulation of both the woodwind dance and the military march.
   The work concludes with a joyful and exuberant coda in which the bass line of the march transforms itself into the well-known "rock and roll" harmonic progression of the 1950s.
   The result is a boisterous and rollicking finale.

最終楽章は輝かしい「トッカータ」です。
この楽章は激しいリズミカルな木管楽器の舞踊によって始まります。
金管楽器と打楽器は気取った軍隊風の行進曲で木管に続きます。
A lyrically lilting, then vigorous middle section leads to a recapitulation of both the woodwind dance and the military march.
The work concludes with a joyful and exuberant coda in which the bass line of the march transforms itself into the well-known "rock and roll" harmonic progression of the 1950s.
最後は騒々しく陽気に騒いでフィナーレを迎えます。

.. rehearsal and performance suggestions

リハーサルと演奏についての提案
-------------------------------------

.. Fanfare

ファンファーレ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In mm.6 and 10 the trumpets must not rush the 32nd notes.
These notes should be executed with their full melodic and rhythmic value.

In the Maestoso sections, the 16th notes written for the brasses should also be executed without rushing.
The appropriate dramatic effect will be best achieved with a boldly accented, yet broad articulation.

.. Aria

アリア
~~~~~~
In m.9 the instruments must be balanced and blended so that the result is a smooth and continuous descending scale.
The crescendo from m.9  to m.10 is also important.

In mm.11-21, the decorated woodwind melody should not sound hurried.
This can be achieved by giving full, expressive melodic value to the 16th and 32nd note melismas.

.. Toccata

トッカータ
~~~~~~~~~~
The Toccata is a movement of driving rhythmic and festive abandon.
Except for the lyrical section from mm.63-87, all articulations and accents should be played with zest, bite and vigor.

THe code, beginning at m.166, is based on an eight-bar "rock and roll" bass line.
This eight-bar phrase is played a total of five times.
Each new repetition of the phrase should give the effect of mounting excitement, as melodies from earlier in the movement are gradually added.
At mm.166, 174, 182, 190 and 198 I have used the words soli and solo to designate which instruments should be highlighted for the listener.
Throughtout this section the percussion is added gradually and should give a culminative drive to the entire coda.

Check carefully the metronome marking at m.215.
The tempo of the final three measures must be broad and deliberate so that the entry of each choir is powerful and the entire cadence has Bach-like gradeur.

Throughout all of the meter changes in the coda, the value of the eighth note remains constant.

.. about the composer

作曲者について
------------------
Born in 1943, Arne Running is a native of Moorhead, Minnesota, attended elementary and secondary school at the campus school of Moorhead State Teachers College and began the study of clarinet at age eleven.
Six years later he was the winner of a state-wide Young Musical Artists competition sponsored by the Minnesota Symphony Orchestra and performed the Mozart Clarinet Concerto with the orchestra.

Running received his BM degree with highers honors in clarinet from the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts, and his MM degree from Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Following graduation he was principal clarinetist with the Pennsylvania Ballet Company orchestra.
Since 1974 he has been an active free-lance musician in Philadelphia and has also performed as a member of the Philadelphia Orchestra.
Since 1968 Running has been principal clarinet instructor at the Jenkintown(PA) Music School.
In 1979 he was appointed conductor of the school's chamber orchestra.

Although Running composed several works for small woodwind groups during his school yeas, it was not until the summer of 1976 that he tried his hand at composing once again.
The result was Chorale and Capriccio for Band.
This was followed in 1978 by Aria and Allegro for Brass Trio.
Both works are available from Shawnee Press.
